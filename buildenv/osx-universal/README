To build an up-to-date Mumble (universal i386/ppc) build environment on OS X, do the following:

1.  Change directory to the OS X buildenv:
  $ cd mumble-releng.git/buildenv/osx/

2.  Create a target directory for the build environment in your home dir:

  $ export MUMBLE_BUILDENV_TARGET=$HOME/MumbleBuild-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
  $ mkdir -p ${MUMBLE_BUILDENV_TARGET}

3.  Copy the 'env' script to the target directory you created in step 2:

  $ cp env ${MUMBLE_BUILDENV_TARGET}/env

4.  Source the env script to set up the proper environment variables for
    the Mumble build environment:

  $ source ${MUMBLE_BUILDENV_TARGET}/env

5.  Build the enviroment:

  $ ./build-all.bash

This will fetch and build all libraries and tools needed to build Mumble
from scratch on OS X.  Enjoy!

NOTE: The above instructions expect you to be on a Snow Leopard (10.6) machine with Xcode 3.2.6 installed.
